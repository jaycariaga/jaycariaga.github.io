Hello Reader!

Today, I would like to talk a little about the mechanical keyboard world for those interested in it or in consideration of partaking in it.  The purpose of this post is more or less documenting my experience so far with upgrading them, mistakes I made in the start, and some information on what to look for. 

>Mechanical Switches

To start, I will talk about the general information on mechanical keyboard parts itself.  We'll start with switches, which are essentially the middle-man that determines which key is pressed so that the pcb/motherboard can communicate with the computer.  Switches come in three types: linear, tactile, and clicky.  

Linear switches actuate in a...well "linear" fashion.  Linears have constant but smooth resistance throughout actuation process for seamless usage.  However, tactiles and clicky switches have a characteristic similar in a way to membrane keyboards in which there is an apparent "bump" feeling between the initial key press and the actuation of the key itself.  

This bump is created by the interference of the switch stem trying to slide underneath the metal leaf inside the switch.  Now, what makes tactiles and clickys different from each other is the sound that comes from a successful key press. Clickys are loud sounding, hence the name, whereas tactiles give off more of a dampened, softer sound.  

In terms of best case usage from the experience of myself and many in the community these switches have its own purpose.  Linears are best for gaming, tactiles are great for typing, and clickys are a great medium between gaming and typing (but will annoy anyone around you eheh).

Knowing which switch to pick from on your first try is a little difficult, unless you know a friend who has sample switches from his own mechanical keyboard(s).  The community itself is very helpful and has been increasing since COVID-19, so my advice if you want to make your best bet on switch choice is looking up sound tests and reviews on youtube or even reddit.  

>Keycaps

Going into keycaps now, there is surprisingly a decent amount of potential in sound that can be brought from specific keycap profiles.  Preferably I like OEM because of its row structures and shape.  Many "quality" keycaps now use Cherry profiles or XDA's based on my experience.  There is also a material type too for keycaps such as PBT, or ABS.  Obviously the looks of the keycaps support the price leveling too but sometimes the price does make a difference.  Some similar keycap sets from different distributors have different qualities of production and sometimes material used.  As a result, doing research on the company and the reviews of the keycaps are very pivotal for getting the right one on the first buy, as you don't want a few warped keys right?

ABS keycaps are usually used as stock keycaps in sets, and are primarily known for being cheaper to buy, but are quieter and shinier.  PBT keycaps meanwhile have a matte appearance with a thickness that yields larger sounds.  These are more durable as well, but in return are more expensive to buy.  There are other different keycap materials too.  The pudding keycaps, for example, provide a rubber coating for better grip.  POM jelly keycaps are small looking but provide a nice aesthetic for rgb light effects.

You could also make your own keycaps using resin or even 3d printing.  But I'll let you know beforehand that the 3d printing option is kind of difficult based on the resolution of your print.  Higher resolution yields more material to make one, but it should most likely be easy to fit the cap in the switch stem.  And resin printing is a whole new world of its own, and that can take a while to do one, let alone the success rate is still risky depending on what tools you have in making molds.

>PCBs

One important thing to note with choosing the type of keyboard or DIY kit is choosing a pcb that is either "hot-swappable" or just regular configuration.  With hot-swappable capabilities, you are able to freely take out and replace your switches as many times as you like without spending time soldering and desoldering.  The downside to this, however, is being able to use any switches outside of its type.  For example, a hot-swappable switch for gateron opticals can allow you to use optical reds, yellows, blues, e.t.c.; but you cannot switch them out for something like a Cherry MX switch or even a normal Gateron switch as well.  In comparison, the regular setup allows you to replace your setup with any switch, but now you need to spend a lot of time soldering and desoldering every switch one by one.  Which in many cases, can take a couple hours by itself to just desolder.  In a way its more like you sacrifice one of two things: time or variability.

Another pcb topic worth noting is the keyboard format.  Full size keyboards have it all: the numpad, the arrow keys, the fn keys, e.t.c.  Tenkeyless boards have everything except the number pad.  And the "compact" or the 60% keyboard as it is commonly called is without fn keys, the numpad, and the arrow key set.  Just noting here that desoldering a full size keyboard took me 2 hours...not the most fun if you wanna do lots of upgrades lol.
