Hello fellow reader,

The purpose of this site is to introduce myself as a person.  My interests include listening to and making music, playing video games, tennis, and creating.  I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rutgers University, and a minor degree in Computer Science.  Some recent developments I have made include audio-visualizing led strips using arduino, a mock-draft of a mobile application for group organizing and management, and server-client programs for database query.  As of now, I am currently seeking employment after graduating this month!

If you have any questions about myself and/or my projects, feel free to contact me via e-mail: jaymcariaga@gmail.com.
Have fun looking through my posts and have a good day!


<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
