Hello fellow reader,

Well, years after my last post, I was able to find a job in Control Systems Engineering and am making more of a career for myself in Software Development and Systems Engineering.  My keyboard hobby was fairly at full force but came to a stop after work and life got very busy.  I now have about 5 keyboards and sold 2 since then.  Learned alot about building customs and using different modifications to alter the sound and overall cost per value. Other than that, I delved into other hobbies that have either come and gone or stayed in my life one way or another.  I took up PC building, application development (once again lol), nintendo console modding, IEMs and the audiophile world, tennis stringing and began to love Kpop XD

Now that it has been a few years since, I learned a few life things here and there.  And I would like to impart some of my information if you, the reader, is willing to read this list: 
1. Don't listen to what anyone says you can't do or makes no sense.  If you think you can achieve it and it makes sense to do so, push away those people from your life and focus on yourself.  After everything, you are the only one you can depend on 100 percent of the time.  Everyone is the center of their own world so don't think that what someone says is always black or white
2. Roth IRAs are absolutely cracked if you are working a full-time job.  Put money into a Mutual S&P 500 fund and call it a day.  Put some more money into your own personal investments such as a High Yield Savings Account or a Traditional IRA.  
3. It's hard to work on yourself. Sometimes, things happen and next thing you start to go down a deeper hole.  Tell yourself this, how do you want to look at your past self if today is that past self?
4. Sometimes, things work out for the better.  Even if it looks bad right now, as long as you hold yourself accountable for your own decisions and try the best you can, things will work out.  I am glad that I can finally work at an environment where my values and opinions are held with respect.
5. Don't be afraid to look at your failures.  These failures make you who you are, NOT what you have succeeded in.  

As time goes on, I hope to add more advice to people willing to listen.  This post is more or less me letting out how I feel here and there, but I would like to at least change someone's life for the better if possible.
